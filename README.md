# Introduction to Machine Learning

## Overview

- The repository provides the solutions to assignments of the course ENPM808A: Introduction to Machine Learning.
- There are several assignments in the repository each of the which have implementations of various algorithms and methods that have been taught as the semester proceeded.
- Each of the assignment has it's own README, which provides insructions for that particular assignment.
- The course had a midterm and a final exam of which, the mid term is present in this repository, the final project has been uploaded as a separate repository for which i will provide a link.
