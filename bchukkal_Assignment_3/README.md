## User Dependencies

- Python 3.9
- IDE to run the program (I used VSCode and Jupyter Notebook)
- Libraries: NumPy, matplotlib.pyplot, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Functools,

## Instructions

- Set the path for the Data before running the program
- Run the file in any IDE with python 3.9
- For optimal visualization, use Jupyter Notebook (but it will open in VSCode)

## Notes

* There are two pdfs, one report that shows outputs of the programming problems and one report that shows solutions to the handwritten problems.
